Software Engineering: The application of engineering principles to software development in a systematic method.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): A process followed for a software project, including phases like planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.

Requirements Engineering: Involves gathering, analyzing, and documenting user requirements.

System Design: The phase where the architecture of the software system is designed.

Modularization: Dividing a software system into smaller, manageable modules.

Design Patterns: Reusable solutions to common problems in software design, such as Singleton, Observer, and Factory patterns.

Object-Oriented Design (OOD): Focuses on designing software using objects and classes.

Agile Methodology: An iterative approach to software development, emphasizing flexibility and customer satisfaction.

Waterfall Model: A linear sequential software development model, where each phase must be completed before the next begins.

Scrum: A framework within Agile methodology, focusing on time-boxed iterations called sprints.

Extreme Programming (XP): An Agile method that emphasizes customer satisfaction, continuous feedback, and small releases.

Test-Driven Development (TDD): A development technique where tests are written before writing the corresponding code.

Version Control Systems (VCS): Tools like Git that manage changes to source code over time.

Continuous Integration (CI): A practice where developers frequently integrate code into a shared repository, minimizing integration problems.

Continuous Deployment (CD): An extension of CI, where code changes are automatically deployed to production after passing tests.

Code Review: A process where developers examine code for errors and improvements before it is merged into the main branch.

Unit Testing: Testing individual components of software to ensure they work as expected.

Integration Testing: Testing the interaction between integrated units to identify interface defects.

System Testing: Testing the entire system as a whole to ensure it meets the requirements.

Acceptance Testing: Validation by the end-user to ensure the system meets their needs and requirements.

Regression Testing: Testing existing software functionality to ensure new changes havenâ€™t introduced bugs.

Scalability: The capability of a software system to handle increased loads.

Performance Testing: Evaluating the speed, responsiveness, and stability of a software system under a workload.

Usability Testing: Assessing how user-friendly and intuitive a software product is.

Security Testing: Ensuring that the software is free from vulnerabilities and unauthorized access.

Data Structures: Organizing data in a way that enables efficient access and modification.

Algorithms: A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or performing a task in software.

Software Architecture: The high-level structure of a software system, defining components and their interactions.

Microservices Architecture: A design approach where a system is composed of loosely coupled, independently deployable services.

Monolithic Architecture: A traditional software architecture where the application is a single, unified unit.

API (Application Programming Interface): A set of protocols and tools for building software and allowing different software systems to communicate.

Middleware: Software that connects different applications or services, enabling them to work together.

Software Maintenance: The process of modifying software after delivery to correct faults, improve performance, or adapt to a changed environment.

Refactoring: The process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior to improve its readability and maintainability.

Legacy System: An old software system that is still in use but may no longer be supported or efficient.

Software Metrics: Quantitative measures used to assess the quality of software, such as code complexity or defect density.

Configuration Management: The process of handling changes to software and ensuring consistency across versions.

Documentation: Comprehensive information about the design, implementation, and use of software.

Software Prototyping: Creating an incomplete version of the software to explore ideas and gather feedback.

User Interface (UI) Design: Designing the part of software that users interact with directly.

User Experience (UX) Design: Focusing on the overall experience of a user when interacting with the software.

Technical Debt: The implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of a better approach that would take longer.

Automation Testing: Using software tools to execute pre-scripted tests on a software application before it is released into production.

Static Code Analysis: The analysis of computer software that is performed without actually executing programs built from that software.

Deployment Pipeline: The automated process of building, testing, and deploying software.

DevOps: A set of practices that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle.

Risk Management: Identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks followed by coordinated application of resources to minimize, control, or mitigate the impact of unfortunate events.

Software Quality Assurance (SQA): A set of activities to ensure that software processes and products conform to requirements and standards.

Code Coverage: A measure used in software testing to describe the degree to which the source code of a program is tested.

Ethics in Software Engineering: The moral principles that guide the conduct of software engineers, including responsibility, integrity, and fairness.
